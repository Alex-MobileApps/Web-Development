			<h2>A Brief History</h2>

<!--1960--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

			<p><strong>1960s - Early Years</strong></p>
			<p>Pink Floyd formed in the early 1960s. In 1967 they would release their debut album &apos;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&apos; led by songwriter Syd Barrett. The album has been recognised for its psychedelic style. It was famously recorded alongside The Beatles&apos; &apos;Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&apos; at the Abbey Road Studios in London. In late 1967, due to health problems, David Gilmour would take over Syd Barrett&apos;s position in the band. Barrett&apos;s last credited song with Pink Floyd would be featured on the band&apos;s 1968 album &apos;A Saucerful of Secrets&apos;. The band would struggle to find a new direction without Barrett and would continue to experiment throughout the rest of the 1960s.</p>

			<p><strong>1970s - International Success</strong></p>
			<p>Pink Floyd found their sound in the early 1970s. &apos;Atom Heart Mother&apos; would reach number 1 on the UK Albums charts and would begin an era of international success for the band. 1971&apos;s &apos;Meddle&apos; featured the 23 minute track &apos;Echoes&apos;, filling the whole second side of the record. This would lay the seeds for band&apos;s upcoming release &apos;The Dark Side of the Moon&apos; in 1973. This album would remain in the US Billboard charts for a record 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. Following on in its success, Pink Floyd would release the albums &apos;Wish You Were Here&apos;, &apos;Animals&apos; and &apos;The Wall&apos; to round out the 1970s. These last four albums are often regarded as the band&apos;s strongest pieces of work.</p>

<!--1980--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

			<p><strong>1980s - A New Era</strong></p>
			<p>Following the release of their previous few albums, the band would struggle to work together with raising tensions towards touring and each other. Richard Wright had already been dismissed from the band in the late 1970s and Roger Waters would continue to lead the band into his final album &apos;The Final Cut&apos; in 1983. Following its release, Waters would step down from Pink Floyd and David Gilmour would take control of the band. Gilmour would bring back Richard Wright and they would release &apos;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&apos; in 1985. Gilmour&apos;s intention was to bring back the band&apos;s sound from their earlier years. They wouldn&apos;t release any more studio albums in the 1980s but would continue to tour with their new lineup.</p>

<!--1990--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

			<p><strong>1990s - Today</strong></p>
			<p>The band released their final studio album of new content in 1994. &apos;The Division Bell&apos; would reach number 1 on most of the charts around the world. The band would tour the new album alongside their older work throughout the United States and Europe. In 2005, Roger Waters rejoined the band for a one-off performance at the Live 8 event. Original frontman Syd Barrett and Richard Wright would pass away in 2006 and 2008 respectively. The final studio album, &apos;The Endless River&apos; was released in 2014 containing instrumentals and ambient music from their old recordings. As of today, the band no longer perform together as Pink Floyd, but their legacy has lived on and has inspired the style of many other musicians.</p>
